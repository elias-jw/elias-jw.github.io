please find all references to heuristic.life and replace them by elias-jw.github.io

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you find and replace all references to "heuristic.life" with "elias-jw.github.io". First, let me search for any occurrences of "heuristic.life" in the codebase.


---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "heuristic\.life" • **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/ejwillemse/dev/personal/elias-jw.github.io/docs/_config.yml` | L24 | `# email: elias@heuristic.life` |
| `file:///Users/ejwillemse/dev/personal/elias-jw.github.io/docs/CNAME` | Lundefined | `heuristic.life` |

</details>

---

I found two files that contain references to "heuristic.life":
1. `docs/_config.yml` - has a commented out email address
2. `docs/CNAME` - contains the domain name

Let me read these files to get more context before making the changes.


---

Read file: docs/_config.yml

---

Read file: docs/CNAME

---

Now I'll make the necessary changes to both files. Let's start with the CNAME file:


---

```diff
- heuristic.life
+ elias-jw.github.io
```

---

Now let's update the _config.yml file:


---

```diff
  # Social Media and Contact
  # If you don't want to use any icon, you can leave them blank.
- # email: elias@heuristic.life
+ # email: elias@elias-jw.github.io
  # facebook_username: thedevslot
  # twitter_username: thedevslot
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Updated the CNAME file to use "elias-jw.github.io" instead of "heuristic.life"
2. Updated the commented out email address in _config.yml to use "elias@elias-jw.github.io" instead of "elias@heuristic.life"

Let me do one final search to make sure we haven't missed any references:


---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "heuristic\.life" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

All references to "heuristic.life" have been replaced with "elias-jw.github.io" in your codebase. There are no remaining instances of "heuristic.life". If you need to update any other references or have further changes, let me know!
