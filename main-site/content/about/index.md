My name is Elias Willemse<sup style="color: #666; font-size: 0.8em;">1</sup> and I'm a technical entrepreneur, based in London, with over 15 years of experience in AI, using it to solve problems in traditional industries (logistics, returnable packaging, waste management, urban planning). It's a journey with unexpected turns, pleasantly unexpected turns.

To list but a few:

- a PhD, in optimization algorithms for waste logistics, of all applications; 
- being a senior lecturer, and having to teach over 1400 students (I'm never doing that again, thank you);
- starting a venture-backed AI company, and closing a venture-backed AI company;
- get ready to start another company, but now more sensibly, given what I've learned  (it's going to be different this time... right?? Right??!!).

All of this, while moving from South Africa to Singapore and now London.

<sup style="color: #666; font-size: 0.8em;">1</sup><span style="color: #666; font-size: 0.8em;">My surname is Willemse, a bit tricky to pronounce. The "W" is pronounced the same as "v" in "violin", the "em" is closer to "uhm". So together it sounds like "Vill-uhm-se".</span>
