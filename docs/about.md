I'm a technical founder, based in London, with over 15 years of hands-on experience in AI and data science. Getting to this point took a while, via a PhD, being a senior lecturer, research fellow, engineering consultant, and moving from South Africa (most of my life) to Singapore (4 years) and now London (since 2022).
